# Text-Excel
A spreadsheet is a two dimensional series of cells indexed by column letters and row numbers. A letter followed by a number identifies cells within spreadsheets (e.g., ”D13” or “F9”).  The cell designated by “C2” means the third column (labeled “C”) and the 2nd row, as in this partial printout of a spreadsheet:

   |A         |B         |C         |D
1  |          |          |          | 
2  |          |          |(cell C2) |
3  |          |          |          |
4  |          |          |          |

It's columns are from A-L and its rows range from 1-20. This program repeatedly accepts commands from the user (to change values stored in cells, perform operations on cells, etc.), until the user types ‘quit’, at which point the program will end.  After some commands, the program will re-print the updated spreadsheet, showing the changes caused by the user.  Commands are described as follows: F7 = “hi”
# sample inputs
B2 = ( 5-6 )
E9 = 5
C2 = 4.5
D1 = ( 2 * 7 / 3 )
D2 = ( 2 + 1 )
F5 = 6.2837%
